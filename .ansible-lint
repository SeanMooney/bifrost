  # FIXME: gradually fix and remove these exclusions:
  - '206'  # Variables should have spaces before and after: {{ var_name }}
  - '208'  # File permissions not mentioned
  - '301'  # Commands should not change things if nothing needs doing
  - '303'  # Using command rather than module
  - '305'  # Use shell only when shell functionality is required
  - '306'  # Shells that use pipes should set the pipefail option
  - '502'  # All tasks should be named
  - '504'  # Do not use 'local_action', use 'delegate_to: localhost'
  - '601'  # Don't compare to literal True/False
  - '602'  # Don't compare to empty string
  - '701'  # meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
  - '702'  # Tags must contain lowercase letters and digits only
  # NOTE(dtantsur): the following rules should likely stay excluded:
  - '106'  # Role name {} does not match ``^[a-z][a-z0-9_]+$`` pattern'
  - '503'  # Tasks that run when changed should likely be handlers
